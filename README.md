# simpleNews
A simple news system for training purposes

A webpage where you can register and log into. 
Once you're logged in you have the choice if you want to see
all entries you created or if you want to create a new one.
You can also edit your entries by clicking on them in the overview.

On the index page the latest entries of any user will be shown. 
You can filter them by username. Use the pagination to get to older entries.

The folder V1 contains the first try at this project. It has most of the functionalities 
of the new version, but it isn't coded very clean.
